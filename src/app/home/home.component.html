    <h2>FAIR and FAIRification</h2>
    <p class="fair-overview-text">FAIR(Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles serve to guide data producers and data publishers to improve their data management practices and improve the reuse of research data<sup>[1]</sup> FAIRification is the process of improving the FAIR level of datasets, projects or related infrastructure.</p>
    <p>The FAIR wizard utilizes FAIRification resources developed by the FAIRplus project and other platforms, suggests FAIRification materials based on the FAIRification requirements, and designs FAIRification solutions for data owners, data stewards, and other people involved in FAIRification. </p>
