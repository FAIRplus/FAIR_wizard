This expansion means that researchers now face a hurdle to extracting the data they need from the large numbers of data that are available. Biomedical researchers have turned to ontologies and terminologies to structure and annotate their data with ontology concepts for better search and retrieval. However, this annotation process cannot be easily automated and often requires expert curators. Plus, there is a lack of easy-to-use systems that facilitate the use of ontologies for annotation. The NCBO Annotator (formerly referred to as the Open Biomedical Annotator (OBA)) is an ontology-based Web service that annotates public datasets with biomedical ontology concepts based on their textual metadata. The biomedical community can use the annotator service to tag their data automatically with ontology concepts. These concepts come from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal ontologies. Such annotations facilitate translational discoveries by integrating annotated data.";

Where mappings are not found in the curated respository one or more ontologies can be selected from the Ontology Lookup Service to increase coverage. For example if you want to map GWAS annotations select the GWAS datasource and a common disease ontology such as EFO or DOID to maximise coverage when terms have no curated mappings.

Use the text box to find possible ontology mappings for free text terms in the ZOOMA repository of curated annotation knowledge. You can add one term (e.g. 'Homo sapiens') per line. If you also have a type for your term (e.g. 'organism'), put this after the term, separated by a tab.
If you are new to ZOOMA, take a look at our getting started guide.""";

Mapping between Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and Gene Ontology (GO) terms for the prediction of gene/protein - function - phenotype - disease associations. In this study, a novel approach is proposed for the identification of relationships between biomedical entities by automatically mapping phenotypic abnormality defining HPO terms with biomolecular function defining GO terms, where each association indicates the occurrence of the abnormality due to the loss of the biomolecular function expressed by the corresponding GO term";
